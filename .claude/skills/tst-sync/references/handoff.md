Write your report to the handoff folder of the step: `dev.md` (developer), `test.md` (tester) or `docs.md`
(documenter). Use these headings in this order. Then return ONLY the "Result" and "Questions for the user" sections as
your final message.

```
## Result
status: pass | fail | blocked | question
summary: <3 lines or less: what you did and the outcome>

## Files changed
<one path per line; "none" when you changed no file>

## Commands run
<command> → <result: exit code and the key numbers>

## Deviations from the brief
<what you did differently from the brief, and why; "none">

## Questions for the user
<only decisions that the user must take; "none">
```

Status meanings:

- `pass`: the work of your stage is complete and every check you ran passed.
- `fail`: (tester) a gate check failed. List each failure under "Commands run" with the evidence.
- `blocked`: you cannot continue for a reason outside the step (a tool is missing, the dev server is down).
- `question`: you need a decision before you can continue. Do not guess.
