# KB index of UI flow SubLayout

KB root: `../ubt_sharing_kb/connect/outsystems/apps` (os-kb extraction of Connect, DEV, 2026-10-05). Paths are relative to the project root (the KB is a sibling folder of the project). Rules quote the model and say `confirmed` or `inferred`.
Referenced modules have their own rule prefixes (UBT_AppManager: `BR-UAM-*`, UBTConnect_Utils: `BR-C2UTL-*`, …): grep the block name under the KB root to find them.
Read the UI pages fully; open a rule file only for the rules the report cites.
