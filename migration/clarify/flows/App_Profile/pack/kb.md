# KB index of UI flow App_Profile

KB root: `../ubt_sharing_kb/connect/outsystems/apps` (os-kb extraction of Connect, DEV, 2026-10-05). Rules quote the model and say `confirmed` or `inferred`.

## Rules (BR-UBTCON-*) whose source element is a screen, block or action of the flow

| Element | Rule | Confidence | Title |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block_PINUnlock | `BR-UBTCON-952` | confirmed | On an unsupported app or WebView version the lock screen shows the upgrade notice |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-948` | confirmed | A wrong PIN shows "Your current PIN is not correct!"; an unknown user shows "No matching user. Please Register a PIN" and is sent to PIN registration; anything else is shown as the plugin reported it |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-949` | confirmed | Biometric unlock is offered on the lock screen only when the user enabled it on this device, and never when re-entering the PIN from the menu |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-950` | confirmed | Forgot PIN sends the user to Login flagged as a PIN reset — the logout call on this path is disabled |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-951` | confirmed | The lock screen links Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy, each only when the cached policy has a URL |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-310` | confirmed | Every screen that embeds the common layout block shows the PIN unlock overlay unless the user is anonymous, the screen opts out, or PIN registration is still pending |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-311` | confirmed | A user who still has policies to accept gets the policy checker on every screen that embeds the common layout block, unless that screen opts out |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-312` | confirmed | After PIN registration the next screen sends Back to Home instead of the browser history — a one-shot flag consumed on a fresh render only |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-313` | confirmed | Pressing Back on the first page of the history does not leave the app: navigation is prevented and Home opens instead |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-833` | confirmed | The directory actions bar offers a fixed set of actions per entity type; a Locality raises "Invalid option" and any other type "Bookmarks not available" |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-834` | confirmed | The actions bar fetches contact details for members, OneSchool Global, supper meetings and households only, and only when a call, e-mail or share action needs them |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-835` | confirmed | After fetching, Call is offered when any phone number exists and E-mail when there is an e-mail address or a mobile number; a fetch error disables every action |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-836` | confirmed | Bookmarking from the actions bar uses the Connect 2 bookmark store when the new-bookmarks flag is on, otherwise the legacy store; the menu shows Bookmark or Unbookmark from the local copy |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-837` | confirmed | Share types are resolved only for entity types that can be shared, and the share pop-up exists only with the extended-share flag |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-838` | confirmed | E-mail for a OneSchool Global entry goes straight to the school e-mail form; for anyone else it opens the message-channel pop-up |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-839` | confirmed | Contact pop-ups for OneSchool Global always use the OneSchool Global image (the host image goes to the share sheet), and a host-supplied name replaces the fetched name |
| Directory_EntityDetailsActions | `BR-UBTCON-840` | confirmed | Deleting a note from the actions bar removes it from the shown list and decrements the note count; the bar shows a skeleton until bookmarks and notes have synced |
| ExitApplicationForWebViewUpdate | `BR-UBTCON-506` | confirmed | The app closes itself after the given delay only where the Cordova exitApp API exists; elsewhere nothing happens |
| GetNameAndSurname_ByFullName | `BR-UBTCON-259` | confirmed | A full name is split on spaces: the last word is the surname and the words before it are the name |
| GetShareType_FromEntity | `BR-UBTCON-244` | confirmed | Share type per entity type — "My Household" is chosen only for an entity type that matched none of the earlier cases, so a Household is always shared as Household |
| GetURLFromEventDataURL | `BR-UBTCON-515` | confirmed | A shared link from the web share page is rewritten into the app's ConnectShare route, and a doubled "UBTConnect/" segment is collapsed |
| GetUserInformation_Wrapper_Assign | `BR-UBTCON-530` | confirmed | Whether the user still has policies to accept is copied from the cached user information onto the device |
| Get_IsUnsupportedSystem | `BR-UBTCON-232` | confirmed | The system is unsupported when either the app version or the browser (WebView) version is unsupported |
| Get_IsUnsupportedVersion | `BR-UBTCON-231` | confirmed | The app version is unsupported when the native shell version is unsupported; the WebView counts as unsupported for the WebView flag only on Android |
| HandleOnResumeOpenLink | `BR-UBTCON-632` | confirmed | A link that arrives while the app is running is opened at once only for a logged-in, unlocked, ready user; otherwise it is parked and opened after login or unlock |
| HandleOnResumeOpenLink | `BR-UBTCON-633` | confirmed | Deep links to a notification message or an Assemble event are ignored here because the push plugin opens them; every other deep link is processed |
| HasAccessToRegion | `BR-UBTCON-252` | confirmed | A Global-plan user has access to every country and locality |
| HasAccessToRegion | `BR-UBTCON-253` | confirmed | A Regional or AdvancePlus user has access to a target whose country is one of their subscribed countries, matched by name or code; the locality is not checked |
| HasAccessToRegion | `BR-UBTCON-254` | confirmed | A Free-plan user has access only to their own country (when no locality is targeted) or their own locality |
| HasAccessToRegion | `BR-UBTCON-255` | confirmed | A user on any plan other than Global, Regional, AdvancePlus or Free has no regional access in the app — the server's map rule grants such plans their subscribed countries |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-812` | confirmed | A hidden household is flagged only on the user's own household ("Your profile is private and only visible to you"); details are never withheld on the client |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-813` | confirmed | A household's address and photo are shown only when the household is not hidden, deceased or ancestry — and the address is non-empty |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-814` | confirmed | The household Photos tab is disabled for deceased, ancestry and hidden households |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-815` | confirmed | From a deceased or ancestry household the locality and supper-meeting links are disabled; otherwise they open with no plan check |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-816` | confirmed | The photobook entry is hidden without the photobook permission and opens only for a household with a locality; otherwise "Photobook is currently unavailable…" |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-817` | confirmed | Sharing a household opens the share sheet only with the extended-share flag (otherwise "coming soon"); deceased households cannot be shared from the actions bar |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-818` | confirmed | Tapping a household member always opens the relations screen when the block is enabled; the away-parent routing is switched off |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-819` | confirmed | A married child (non-household member) opens their own household when the block is enabled |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-820` | confirmed | In profile preview, the household shows the user's unsaved account form: address, age display, and only the phone numbers marked shown |
| HouseholdDetails_Block | `BR-UBTCON-821` | confirmed | Household ages follow the viewer's own age-visibility setting, and a cached household is refetched when that setting changed |
| HouseholdDetails_Members_Block | `BR-UBTCON-823` | confirmed | Tapping a household member's row opens relations for anyone but a child; the navigation chevron follows the server's flag, the row tap ignores it |
| HouseholdDetails_Members_Block | `BR-UBTCON-824` | confirmed | A married child's household opens only when the plan covers their locality — the row tap does not check the server's navigation flag |
| HouseholdDetails_Members_Block | `BR-UBTCON-825` | confirmed | Member contact actions appear only when the server marks the member as having CTAs, and call/e-mail are disabled for a deceased member; lifecycle text is shown as sent |
| HouseholdDetails_TimelinePhoto | `BR-UBTCON-843` | confirmed | A household timeline photo is drawn only when it has a background image |
| IsHouseholdDetails_InAncestryModeView | `BR-UBTCON-518` | confirmed | A household is in ancestry-mode view only if its id is in an in-memory list kept on the page window |
| OfflineDataSync | `BR-UBTCON-520` | confirmed | The offline data synchronization does nothing: the action goes straight from Start to End and ignores SyncUnit |
| OfflineDataSyncConfiguration | `BR-UBTCON-521` | confirmed | Offline sync is set to start automatically when the device comes online, at login and on resume, with no retry on error |
| OfflineDataSyncEvents | `BR-UBTCON-340` | confirmed | An offline sync run ends as success, as a retryable error, or — on a security exception — as a non-retryable error |
| OpenGooglePlay_Chrome | `BR-UBTCON-524` | confirmed | The Chrome update link opens the Google Play page of package com.android.chrome |
| OpenGooglePlay_UBTConnect | `BR-UBTCON-526` | confirmed | The app update link opens the Google Play page of the running app's own package name |
| OpenGooglePlay_WebView | `BR-UBTCON-525` | confirmed | The WebView update link opens the Google Play page of package com.google.android.webview |
| Policy_Checker | `BR-UBTCON-940` | confirmed | While the device flag says policies are pending, every screen whose layout does not opt out is redirected to Accept Pending Policies |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-988` | confirmed | Only the householder can edit the address and home number; personal and contact sections are shown to the householder and the householder's spouse |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-989` | confirmed | On save a householder must have a locality, a subdivision and every required address line; other members are validated on the form only |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-990` | confirmed | The client decides whether a save needs a directory change request — address, username, email or any phone changed — and the server trusts that flag; the save always reports "Your update request has been submitted." |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-991` | confirmed | After a save the cached visibility settings are always refreshed: the ChangedVisibilityPreferences check compares the form with a copy taken one node earlier, so its true arm ("unchanged") always runs |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-992` | confirmed | Toggling "show my age" asks for confirmation with a reciprocity warning — show yours to see others' birth date and age; cancelling flips the switch back |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-993` | confirmed | Leaving Profile by back with unsaved changes asks to discard them |
| Profile | `BR-UBTCON-994` | confirmed | Choosing a locality clears the subdivision and narrows the subdivision list; the address-format refresh for a locality in another country is skipped by a constant |
| SetResumeLoginLink | `BR-UBTCON-527` | confirmed | A deep link to open after login is parked on the page window, where GetResumeLoginLink later reads and clears it |
| ToggleBookmarkItem_C2 | `BR-UBTCON-237` | confirmed | Connect 2 bookmarking: the device copy is created only after the server confirms the add; a failure shows the add-error toast |
| ToggleBookmarkItem_C2 | `BR-UBTCON-238` | confirmed | Connect 2 un-bookmarking: the device copy is deleted only after the server confirms the delete; a failure shows the remove-error toast |
| Try_GetIsSupportedVersion | `BR-UBTCON-233` | confirmed | If the version check fails, the app treats both the native version and the WebView as supported |
| UnsupportedVersion_Wrapper | `BR-UBTCON-337` | confirmed | An unsupported native app gets the upgrade-app card; otherwise an unsupported Android WebView gets the update-WebView card; otherwise the unsupported-browser card — and Back is blocked while it shows |
| Upgrade_WebView | `BR-UBTCON-234` | confirmed | To update the WebView, Android below 10 is sent to the Chrome store page and Android 10+ to Android System WebView, then the app closes after 10 seconds |
