# KB index of UI flow App_Common_Blocks

KB root: `../ubt_sharing_kb/connect/outsystems/apps` (os-kb extraction of Connect, DEV, 2026-10-05). Paths are relative to the project root (the KB is a sibling folder of the project). Rules quote the model and say `confirmed` or `inferred`.
Referenced modules have their own rule prefixes (UBT_AppManager: `BR-UAM-*`, UBTConnect_Utils: `BR-C2UTL-*`, …): grep the block name under the KB root to find them.
Read the UI pages fully; open a rule file only for the rules the report cites.

## Rules (BR-UBTCON-*) whose source element is a screen, block or action of the flow

| Element | Rule | Confidence | Title |
|---|---|---|---|
| App_IconBadge | `BR-UBTCON-319` | confirmed | An icon badge shows its number only when it is not zero, and shows a skeleton while loading or while the count is still unknown (-1) |
| App_NotificationIcon | `BR-UBTCON-320` | confirmed | The notification bell opens the new Notifications screen when the new-notifications flag is on, otherwise the legacy message list; its badge stays loading until notifications are synched |
| External_Link | `BR-UBTCON-334` | confirmed | An external link opens through the RedirectToURL external site on iOS and through the in-app browser helper elsewhere |
| ItemCardActions | `BR-UBTCON-335` | confirmed | Un-bookmarking from a card always tells the parent the item was unbookmarked, even when the server delete failed |
| ToggleBookmarkItem_C2 | `BR-UBTCON-237` | confirmed | Connect 2 bookmarking: the device copy is created only after the server confirms the add; a failure shows the add-error toast |
| ToggleBookmarkItem_C2 | `BR-UBTCON-238` | confirmed | Connect 2 un-bookmarking: the device copy is deleted only after the server confirms the delete; a failure shows the remove-error toast |
