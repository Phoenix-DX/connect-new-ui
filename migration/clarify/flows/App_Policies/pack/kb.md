# KB index of UI flow App_Policies

KB root: `../ubt_sharing_kb/connect/outsystems/apps` (os-kb extraction of Connect, DEV, 2026-10-05). Rules quote the model and say `confirmed` or `inferred`.
Read the UI pages fully; open a rule file only for the rules the report cites.

## Rules (BR-UBTCON-*) whose source element is a screen, block or action of the flow

| Element | Rule | Confidence | Title |
|---|---|---|---|
| AcceptPendingPolicies | `BR-UBTCON-946` | confirmed | After acceptance the pending flag is cleared in the cached user info and on the device, and the user returns to the previous screen; back navigation is blocked while policies are pending |
| Block_PINUnlock | `BR-UBTCON-952` | confirmed | On an unsupported app or WebView version the lock screen shows the upgrade notice |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-948` | confirmed | A wrong PIN shows "Your current PIN is not correct!"; an unknown user shows "No matching user. Please Register a PIN" and is sent to PIN registration; anything else is shown as the plugin reported it |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-949` | confirmed | Biometric unlock is offered on the lock screen only when the user enabled it on this device, and never when re-entering the PIN from the menu |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-950` | confirmed | Forgot PIN sends the user to Login flagged as a PIN reset — the logout call on this path is disabled |
| Block_PINUnlock_ContentWrapper | `BR-UBTCON-951` | confirmed | The lock screen links Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy, each only when the cached policy has a URL |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-310` | confirmed | Every screen that embeds the common layout block shows the PIN unlock overlay unless the user is anonymous, the screen opts out, or PIN registration is still pending |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-311` | confirmed | A user who still has policies to accept gets the policy checker on every screen that embeds the common layout block, unless that screen opts out |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-312` | confirmed | After PIN registration the next screen sends Back to Home instead of the browser history — a one-shot flag consumed on a fresh render only |
| CommonUI_InsideLayout | `BR-UBTCON-313` | confirmed | Pressing Back on the first page of the history does not leave the app: navigation is prevented and Home opens instead |
| ExitApplicationForWebViewUpdate | `BR-UBTCON-506` | confirmed | The app closes itself after the given delay only where the Cordova exitApp API exists; elsewhere nothing happens |
| GetSVGMetric | `BR-UBTCON-514` | confirmed | The header height without its curve is the rendered path height scaled by the highest straight-edge Y over the highest curve coordinate |
| GetURLFromEventDataURL | `BR-UBTCON-515` | confirmed | A shared link from the web share page is rewritten into the app's ConnectShare route, and a doubled "UBTConnect/" segment is collapsed |
| Get_IsUnsupportedSystem | `BR-UBTCON-232` | confirmed | The system is unsupported when either the app version or the browser (WebView) version is unsupported |
| Get_IsUnsupportedVersion | `BR-UBTCON-231` | confirmed | The app version is unsupported when the native shell version is unsupported; the WebView counts as unsupported for the WebView flag only on Android |
| HandleOnResumeOpenLink | `BR-UBTCON-632` | confirmed | A link that arrives while the app is running is opened at once only for a logged-in, unlocked, ready user; otherwise it is parked and opened after login or unlock |
| HandleOnResumeOpenLink | `BR-UBTCON-633` | confirmed | Deep links to a notification message or an Assemble event are ignored here because the push plugin opens them; every other deep link is processed |
| OfflineDataSync | `BR-UBTCON-520` | confirmed | The offline data synchronization does nothing: the action goes straight from Start to End and ignores SyncUnit |
| OfflineDataSyncConfiguration | `BR-UBTCON-521` | confirmed | Offline sync is set to start automatically when the device comes online, at login and on resume, with no retry on error |
| OfflineDataSyncEvents | `BR-UBTCON-340` | confirmed | An offline sync run ends as success, as a retryable error, or — on a security exception — as a non-retryable error |
| OpenGooglePlay_Chrome | `BR-UBTCON-524` | confirmed | The Chrome update link opens the Google Play page of package com.android.chrome |
| OpenGooglePlay_UBTConnect | `BR-UBTCON-526` | confirmed | The app update link opens the Google Play page of the running app's own package name |
| OpenGooglePlay_WebView | `BR-UBTCON-525` | confirmed | The WebView update link opens the Google Play page of package com.google.android.webview |
| Policy_Checker | `BR-UBTCON-940` | confirmed | While the device flag says policies are pending, every screen whose layout does not opt out is redirected to Accept Pending Policies |
| Policy_Custom_AcceptPendingPolicies | `BR-UBTCON-941` | confirmed | Continue stays disabled until every pending policy is ticked |
| Policy_Custom_AcceptPendingPolicies | `BR-UBTCON-942` | confirmed | An "I agree to all" toggle is offered only when more than one policy is pending; each row reads "I agree to the <application> - <policy type>" |
| Policy_Custom_AcceptPendingPolicies | `BR-UBTCON-943` | confirmed | Accepting sends the ticked policy ids and four device details; the result is not inspected — the screen is told all were accepted |
| Policy_Custom_AcceptPendingPolicies | `BR-UBTCON-944` | confirmed | Pending policies are fetched for the user's country and the Connect, Directory and Orbit applications; when none are pending the block waits five seconds and reports all accepted |
| Policy_Custom_AcceptPendingPolicies | `BR-UBTCON-945` | confirmed | Tapping a policy title opens it in a new tab when it can be opened by URL, otherwise through the policy viewer — ignored while a policy is already loading |
| SetResumeLoginLink | `BR-UBTCON-527` | confirmed | A deep link to open after login is parked on the page window, where GetResumeLoginLink later reads and clears it |
| ShowCommunicationExceptionMessage | `BR-UBTCON-213` | confirmed | A connectivity error is reported as a service interruption when the device is known to be online, and as "No internet connection" otherwise |
| Try_GetIsSupportedVersion | `BR-UBTCON-233` | confirmed | If the version check fails, the app treats both the native version and the WebView as supported |
| UnsupportedVersion_Wrapper | `BR-UBTCON-337` | confirmed | An unsupported native app gets the upgrade-app card; otherwise an unsupported Android WebView gets the update-WebView card; otherwise the unsupported-browser card — and Back is blocked while it shows |
| Upgrade_WebView | `BR-UBTCON-234` | confirmed | To update the WebView, Android below 10 is sent to the Chrome store page and Android 10+ to Android System WebView, then the app closes after 10 seconds |
